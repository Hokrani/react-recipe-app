# **Receipe**

### Introduction

Welcome to Receipe, a  app simple React.js web application! The application connects 
to the "TheMealDB" API from `https://www.themealdb.com`, which hosts many free recipes 
from meaty dishes to vegan delicacies and more. This is a simple project I made to try my hand on 
creating an intuitive React web application. It support all device including mobile. 

## Technologies used

- Node JS
- React JS
- Redux 
- Saga Middleware
- Material-ui
- TheMealDB API


### Prerequisites for running on local machine

1. Node JS   

### Running the application on the local machine

1. Pull the git project to a directory of your choosing
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the source code
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies for the project
4. Run `npm start` to start the web application 
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your favorite web browser if web application has not automatically been opened
6. Use the application to your heart's content! :)

### Improvement 
1. Using back-end server (like express.js), fetch the data and send to front end server. 


### Conclusion
The same application can be developed using React Native for mobile.
